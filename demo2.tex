\section{Hello World!}

\textbf{Hello World!} 
\LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. 
I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
I can also give equations their own space:

\begin{equation} % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as math
  \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
\end{equation}
If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).
Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
\LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.
